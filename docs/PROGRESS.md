# Implementation progress

| Phase | Status | Date | Verification summary | Known issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Foundation | Partial; blocked | 2026-10-09 | setup/lint/strict types/health schema drift pass; 11 backend unit + 4 frontend tests pass; real DB test and full-stack health acceptance fail | Docker absent; API correctly reports database unavailable |
| 1 — Schema and data | Not started | — | 0 tables; no generated data; no migrations or DQ executed | Phase 0 DoD not met |
| 2 — SQL analytics | Not started | — | 0 views or analyses executed; no SQL benchmarks | Phase 1 DoD not met |
| 3–9 | Outside this session's scope | — | None | Stage 1 stops before forecasting |

## 2026-10-09 verification and limitations

Exact commands and real outputs are summarized in root `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.
Environment: macOS 15.6.1 arm64, Python 3.12.7, Node 22.23.3, uv 0.13.0.

- `make setup`: passed locked installation; npm reports known development advisories.
- `make db-up`: failed because Docker executable is absent.
- `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make check-openapi`: passed.
- `backend/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests/unit -q`: 11 passed, 0.34 s.
- `make test`: 11 passed, 1 failed, 0.50 s; actual PostgreSQL connectivity failure. No skipping.
- `make test-frontend`: 4 passed, 0.899 s (includes root-env regression).
- `npm run format:check --prefix frontend`: passed.
- Production build passed after the environment regression fix (379 ms compile, 1.267 s TypeScript, 252 ms static generation).
- `make verify`: failed at the unchanged real DB test (11 passed, 1 failed, 0.59 s); lint and type checks passed first.
- Real HTTP health: HTTP 200 with database unavailable, as required by docs/08 §3.1.
- `make e2e`: 1 failed, 5.3 s; actual page says API ok / Database unavailable. The required healthy-DB assertion remains intact.
- Independent review found a root .env caching bug; regression reproduced and fixed. Relative backend config paths remain a deferred minor before Phase 1 use.

No data generation, migrations, SQL semantics, query performance, or Docker image builds are claimed verified. Five high npm development advisory entries remain rooted in braces; ESLint 9 deprecation is constrained by plugin peer compatibility. MIT owner placeholder remains per spec.

Resume: install/start Docker Desktop, complete Phase 0 health/integration gate, then implement Phase 1, then Phase 2. Original design files are preserved in Git baseline e1e45fe; only docs/02 §9 is annotated to distinguish present commands from future full-project commands.
